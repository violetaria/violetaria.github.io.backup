Hubby and I are making dumplings again, every Sunday if we can manage it.  It's been a nice adventure to learn about his culture while exploring ways to incorporate things from mine into it.  We've been straying away from traditional pork and scallion dumplings and finally found frozen dumpling wrappers that are good enough to use (although I prefer fresh dough if we can make it).  Last week's experiment (3 mushroom dumplings) was not super successful, so I decided to go with flavors I've had in store bought dumplings.  

This week, we used ground chicken for the main protein and threw in some corn and wood ear mushrooms in place of our typical ground pork.  We often add in brown beech (or any fresh mushrooms we have laying around) since they help make the dumplings tender.  If you've ever had a dumpling that has a meatball mouth feel, you will understand!  The dumplings came out great and I'll be making these again. Here's what we used and some pictures:
